The BitcoinCore.org website is the official website for the Bitcoin Core project. Other sites may also host information about Bitcoin Core, but they are not under the control of the Bitcoin Core project. We know that the Bitcoin ecosystem can be confusing, and we are working hard to make these relationships more clear.

For development work, Bitcoin Core mainly uses `#bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel on Freenode, [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [the bitcoin-dev mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/). We also recently created a community Slack group (request an invitation [here](https://slack.bitcoincore.org)) which is not meant to be a developer channel, but to enable the greater Bitcoin community to connect with Bitcoin Core developers and contributors more easily.

While there are many forums in which the Bitcoin community and, indeed, Bitcoin Core contributors engage, Bitcoin Core is not responsible for those forums. Still, we believe it is critical that the Bitcoin community be able to freely, openly, and civilly discuss and critique any and all changes to the system, no matter their desired forum. However, we also recognize that different venues have specific purposes and their policies must be respected. The Bitcoin community can become extremely excited and heated when it comes to discussing Bitcoin, but we must all work to maintain a civil tone. Community members should not disrupt open discussion by engaging in brigading or denial-of-service attacks, and we should all do our best to assume good faith in absence of reason to believe otherwise.

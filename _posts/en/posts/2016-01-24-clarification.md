The BitcoinCore.org website is now the official website for the Bitcoin Core project. Other sites may also host information about Bitcoin Core, but they are not under the control of the Bitcoin Core project. We know that the Bitcoin ecosystem can be confusing, and we are working hard to make these relationships more clear.

For development work, Bitcoin Core mainly uses `#bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel on Freenode, [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [the bitcoin-dev mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/). We also recently created a community Slack group (request an invitation [here](https://slack.bitcoincore.org)) which is not meant to be a developer channel, but to enable the greater Bitcoin community to connect with Bitcoin Core developers and contributors more easily.

Historically, Bitcoin.org was originally used by Satoshi Nakamoto to host his [Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Soon after, it began linking to downloadable versions of the original Bitcoin software, making it the homepage for the [Bitcoin program](https://bitcoin.org/en/download).

New educational content about Bitcoin was added to Bitcoin.org over time, but that home page remained even when the name of the original program was changed to Bitcoin Core. In the years since, the amount of content on Bitcoin.org has continued to increase. Thereâ€™s more content about Bitcoin Core than ever before and also more content about other Bitcoin software and resources. Bitcoin.org provides extremely valuable content about Bitcoin and has a thriving community of contributors. 

As of Dec 2015, Bitcoin.org has 876 pages in 25 different languages, but fewer than 100 of those pages relate to Bitcoin Core. The Bitcoin Core project has no control over those non-Core pages or any policies enacted on them. Likewise, content provided through the Bitcoin Core pages is not necessarily endorsed or supported by the Bitcoin.org contributors.

As of January 2016, Bitcoin Core opened its own project website to further help separate concerns. Our timeline was accelerated because of the delisting of Coinbase on Bitcoin.org.

Likewise, the "r/bitcoin" subreddit is not under the control of the Bitcoin Core project and their policies are their own. We recognise that large public forums do require some moderation policies but may have been too heavy handed.

We encourage the Bitcoin community to civilly discuss and critique any and all changes to the system, we believe discussion of rule changes to Bitcoin to  should happen freely in public forums. However, we also recognize that different venues have specific purposes and policies that must be respected. The wider community can become extremely excited and heated when it comes to discussing Bitcoin; although it is generally considered wrong to engage in brigading or denial-of-service attacks, and best to assume good faith in absence of reason to believe otherwise.
